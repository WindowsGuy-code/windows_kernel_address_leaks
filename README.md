This is a fork of a projekt for leaking the Kernel address,  
I forked this project for fixing all methods.  
I actually wanted to just commit, but I am quite new to github. If anyone knows how to properly do this,  
please just commit the answer into this read me file.


## Fixed:
- HMValidateHandle
- NtQuerySystemModuleInformation
